A knee arthroplasty includes repairing or replacing damaged or diseased articular surfaces of the tibia or femur. The arthroplasty procedure may include cutting (e.g., resecting) one or more articular surfaces of the tibia and femur and replacing a portion of each articular surface with a prosthesis (e.g., articular surface implant). A total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may be used to repair all articular surfaces of the tibia and femur, whereas a partial knee arthroplasty (PKA) may be used to repair a portion of the articular surfaces of the knee, such as the medial, lateral, or patellofemoral compartment. The TKA and PKA procedures require precise resections of the tibia and femur. The cut depth for each resection is specific to the patient and each prosthesis. A surgeon may validate a resection depth manually by inserting a trial prosthesis and exercising the knee through various motions. However, this resection validation is subjective and subject to errors. What is needed is an improved knee arthroplasty resection validation.</p></shortsum><shortdesdrw><p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p><p>[0004] FIG. <b>1</b> is a perspective view of a tracked knee arthroplasty system, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0005] FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B are perspective views of a tracked knee arthroplasty system, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0006] FIG. <b>3</b> is a perspective view of a tracked knee arthroplasty system, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0007] FIG. <b>4</b> is a perspective view of a tracked knee arthroplasty system, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0008] FIG. <b>5</b> is a tibial resection diagram, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0009] FIG. <b>6</b> is a tibial resection slope graph, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0010] FIG. <b>7</b> is a diagram of a knee arthroplasty graphical user interface (GUI), in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0011] FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D are diagrams of an augment cut validation, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0012] FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C are diagrams of an augment cut validation device, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0013] FIG. <b>10</b> is a diagram of an augment cut validation tracker device, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0014] FIG. <b>11</b> illustrates a flow chart showing a knee arthroplasty technique, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p>[0015] FIG. <b>12</b> illustrates an example of a block diagram of a machine upon which any one or more of the techniques (e.g., methodologies) discussed herein may perform in accordance with some embodiments.</p></shortdesdrw><p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</p><p>[0016] The present disclosure describes technical solutions to various technical problems facing knee arthroplasty procedures. To address technical problems facing knee arthroplasty resection validation, the present subject matter provides a tracked knee arthroplasty instrument for objective measurement of resection depth. By performing a precise comparison between the location of the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument and a reference location, the knee arthroplasty instrument measures and validates each tibial and femoral resection. To address technical problems facing validation of joint laxity following knee arthroplasty, the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument is shaped to validate the flexion gap and extension gap. When the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument is inserted between the resected tibial plateau and femoral head, the instrument shape validates whether the desired flexion gap and extension gap have been achieved.</p><p>[0017] In an example PKA surgical procedure, a tibia is resected, the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument is used to validate the resection and check flexion gap and extension gap, the femur is resected, and the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument is again used to validate the resection and check gaps. The use of the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument to validate resections and check gaps ensures that bone gaps and soil tissue allow for sufficient space for an implant and sufficient space in the postoperative elongated leg. In addition to validating resections and checking gaps, the use of the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument provides information regarding limb alignment and tactile feel of the resected surfaces.</p><p>[0018] The tracked knee arthroplasty instrument may be used with a robotic surgical device. In an example, a robotic surgical device may perform a tibial or femoral resection, and the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument may be used by a surgeon or by the robotic surgical device to validate resections and check gaps. In an example, the robotic surgical device may position resection surgical tools to prepare for the resection, a surgeon may perform a tibial or femoral resection, and the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument may be used by a surgeon or by the robotic surgical device to validate resections and check gaps. The robotic surgical system and tracked knee arthroplasty instrument may use a combination of one or more coordinate systems or tracked positioning systems. In an example, the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument is tracked using an optical tracking system, the robotic surgical device uses a robotic device coordinate system, and a surgical plan management system translates the tracked knee arthroplasty instrument position and robotic surgical device position into a common coordinate system viewable by the surgeon.</p><p>[0019] In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views. Like numerals having different letter suffixes may represent different instances of similar components. The drawings illustrate generally, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, various embodiments discussed in the present document.</p><p>[0020] FIG. <b>1</b> is a perspective view of a tracked knee arthroplasty system <b>100</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. System <b>100</b> includes an arthroplasty validation instrument <b>110</b>, where instrument <b>110</b> includes one or more articular contact surfaces that may be placed in contact with a resected tibial surface. In an example, a horizontal resection validation surface on the bottom surface (not shown) of instrument <b>110</b> may be placed on the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>150</b>. Similarly, a vertical resection validation surface on the distant surface (not shown) of instrument <b>110</b> may be placed on the vertical resection <b>155</b> (e.g., tibial sagittal resection).</p><p>[0021] The thickness (e.g., height) of instrument <b>110</b> separates the top surface from the horizontal resection validation surface on the bottom surface (not shown) of instrument <b>110</b>. This gap validation thickness may be used to validate the gap between the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>150</b> and the femoral head <b>160</b>. FIG. <b>1</b> shows the gap validation thickness being used to validate the extension gap while the knee is in flexion, though the gap validation thickness may also be used to validate the flexion gap while the knee is in extension.</p><p>[0022] Instrument <b>110</b> may be attached to a manual manipulation device <b>120</b>. The manipulation device <b>120</b> may include grooves, a grip, or other surface to improve the ability of a surgeon to manipulate the instrument <b>110</b>. The instrument <b>110</b> or the manipulation device <b>120</b> may include an orientation mechanism (e.g., detent, keying surface) to ensure the instrument <b>110</b> and manipulation device <b>120</b> are attached in a reliable and precise configuration. In an example, the instrument <b>110</b> includes a threaded aperture and the manipulation device <b>120</b> includes a threaded socket, and a threaded screw <b>130</b> is attached through the instrument <b>110</b> into the manipulation device <b>120</b>.</p><p>[0023] The manipulation device <b>120</b> may be attached to a location tracking device <b>140</b>, such as an optical tracker. The tracking device <b>140</b> may be used by an optical tracking system to determine the precise location of the instrument <b>110</b>. In an example, once the instrument <b>110</b> is positioned against the horizontal resection <b>150</b> and against the vertical resection <b>155</b>, the tracking device <b>140</b> may be used to validate the horizontal resection <b>150</b> and the vertical resection <b>155</b>. The validation of the horizontal resection <b>150</b> may include determining a resection cut depth, a varus or valgus angle, a resection slope, or other horizontal resection geometry. The validation of the vertical resection <b>155</b> may include determining a resection rotation, a resection medial-lateral offset, or other vertical resection geometry.</p><p>[0024] In another example, the position of the instrument <b>110</b> may be tracked to ensure the instrument <b>110</b> is inserted to a sufficient depth between the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>150</b> and the native femoral head <b>160</b> or a distal femoral resection, where the gap validation thickness (e.g., height) of instrument <b>110</b> is used to validate the gap between the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>150</b> and the native femoral head <b>160</b> or a distal femoral resection. The optical system may determine the position of the tracking device <b>140</b> relative to another tracked position, such as relative to an optical tracker fixedly attached to the patient tibia, relative to a registration pointer attached to a robotic arm, or relative to another tracked position.</p><p>[0025] FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B are perspective views of a tracked knee arthroplasty system <b>200</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. System <b>200</b> includes an arthroplasty validation instrument <b>210</b> attached to a manual manipulation device <b>220</b>, such as using a threaded screw <b>130</b> threaded through instrument <b>210</b> into manipulation device <b>220</b>. Instrument <b>210</b> may include a proximate portion <b>225</b> that is proximate to the manipulation device <b>220</b>, and may include a distal portion <b>215</b> that is distal from the manipulation device <b>220</b>.</p><p>[0026] As shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A, the proximate portion <b>225</b> may be thicker than the distal portion <b>215</b>. The use of different thicknesses may be used to validate different gap sizes, such as validating a posterior gap on a posterior portion of a tibial plateau resection and a larger anterior gap on an anterior portion of the tibial plateau resection. Instrument <b>210</b> may include a transition region <b>235</b> between the proximate portion <b>225</b> and the distal portion <b>215</b>. The transition region <b>235</b> may facilitate insertion of the instrument <b>210</b> between the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>150</b> and the femoral head <b>160</b>, such as by providing a linear sigmoid, or other smooth transition between the proximate portion <b>225</b> and the distal portion <b>215</b>.</p><p>[0027] As shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B, the proximate portion <b>225</b> may be wider than the distal portion <b>215</b>. The wider proximate portion <b>225</b> may be used to provide a mechanical stop, such as by providing a stop against an anterior tibial surface when inserted between the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>150</b> and the femoral head <b>160</b>.</p><p>[0028] FIG. <b>3</b> is a perspective view of a tracked knee arthroplasty system <b>300</b>, in accordance with some embodiments, System <b>300</b> includes a proximate portion <b>325</b> of an arthroplasty validation instrument, which may be inserted into a patient incision <b>350</b>. The proximate portion <b>325</b> may be attached to a manual manipulation device <b>220</b>. The manipulation device <b>320</b> may include a pointed tip portion <b>340</b> that is received within a tip receptacle within proximate portion <b>325</b>. Once the pointed tip portion <b>340</b> is seated correctly within the tip receptacle, the manipulation device <b>320</b> may be secured to the proximate portion <b>325</b> using a threaded screw <b>330</b>.</p><p>[0029] FIG. <b>4</b> is a perspective view of a tracked knee arthroplasty system <b>400</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. System <b>400</b> includes an arthroplasty validation instrument <b>410</b>, where instrument <b>410</b> includes one or more articular contact surfaces that may be placed in contact with a resected tibial surface. A horizontal resection validation surface on the bottom surface (not shown) of instrument <b>410</b> may be placed on the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>450</b>. Similarly, a vertical resection validation surface on the distant surface (not shown) of instrument <b>410</b> may be placed on the vertical resection <b>455</b> (e.g., tibial sagittal resection). Instrument <b>410</b> may be attached to a manual manipulation device <b>420</b>, such as using a threaded screw <b>430</b> threaded through instrument <b>410</b> into the manipulation device <b>420</b>, Manipulation device <b>420</b> may be connected to an optical tracker or other tracking device (not shown).</p><p>[0030] The thickness of instrument <b>410</b> separates the top surface from the horizontal resection validation surface on the bottom surface (not shown) of instrument <b>410</b>. This gap validation thickness may be used to validate the gap between the tibial plateau horizontal resection <b>450</b> and the resected femoral head <b>460</b>. FIG. <b>4</b> shows the gap validation thickness being used to validate the extension gap while the knee is in flexion, though the gap validation thickness may also be used to validate the flexion gap while the knee is in extension.</p><p>[0031] Instrument <b>410</b> includes an anterior stop <b>440</b>. When fully inserted, the anterior stop <b>440</b> rests against the tibial anterior cortex <b>470</b>. The anterior stop <b>440</b> may be used to minimize or prevent instrument <b>410</b> from migrating during drilling, pinning, impaction, or other surgical procedures. When used with a tracking device, the anterior stop <b>440</b> may be used to provide key cortex location information or other tracking information, which may be used to make more precise recuts in imageless cases. This tracking information may reduce or prevent the need for discrete (e.g., dedicated) digitization or registration pointer checks.</p><p>[0032] Instrument <b>410</b> may include one or more structural features to provide additional validation information. The length of instrument <b>410</b> may be used to locate the tibial posterior cortex while validating the tibial plateau resection plane. In an example, instrument <b>410</b> may include distal tibial hooks, distal tibial stops, or other mechanical features (not shown) extending beyond the end of instrument <b>410</b> to locate the posterior cortex. This determined location of the posterior cortex may assist in finding additional reference locations for anatomic landmarking, such as to define the tibial internal and external rotation coordinate system at the plane of the tibial resection. The combination of distal tibial hook and the anterior stop <b>440</b> may be used to provide information about the geometry of the tibia, which may be used to size the tibia. In an example, instrument <b>410</b> may include medial or lateral tibial side hooks or other mechanical features (not shown) extending to either side of instrument <b>410</b>. The side hooks may be used to map the size and geometry of the medial cortex or lateral cortex. This cortex information may be used for femoral sizing, such as selecting standard or narrow femoral head implants. In an example, instrument <b>410</b> may include a distal trochlea stylus (not shown), which might be used to locate or map the femoral trochlea (e.g., intercondylar fossa of femur). The trochlea stylus may provide anterior reference information, which may be used to improve femoral sizing or notching information within a resection. Information from the anterior stop <b>440</b> or one or more tibial hooks may be used to validate resections or update anatomic information. In an example, anatomic information may be gathered through preoperative digitization of the bone, and the preoperatively gathered information may be updated using intraoperative information gathered from the anterior stop <b>440</b> or one or more tibial hooks. This updated information may be used to refresh or improve surgical plans intraoperatively while reducing or minimizing additional intraoperative surgical procedure steps.</p><p>[0033] FIG. <b>5</b> is a tibial resection diagram <b>500</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. A surgeon may use an arthroplasty validation instrument to determine that the depth or slope of the primary cut <b>510</b> (e.g., initial tibial resection) is insufficient, and that a secondary cut <b>520</b> (e.g., secondary resection) may be needed. To change the slope of a tibial resection, the secondary cut <b>520</b> must begin at a lower point on the tibial anterior cortex to ensure a full resection. The starting points of the primary cut <b>510</b> and the secondary cut <b>520</b> may be separated by a cut bias <b>530</b>. To minimize the number of additional tibial resections, the cut bias <b>530</b> may be selected to be the smallest bias that is sufficiently large to perform the secondary cut <b>520</b>. This may be particularly useful when performing a secondary cut <b>520</b> where there is insufficient information available about the location of the tibial anterior cortex, such as in imageless arthroplasty procedures. The bias selection may be improved by determining information about the location of the anterior cortex, such as using the anterior stop <b>440</b> to provide cortex location information.</p><p>[0034] FIG. <b>6</b> is a tibial resection slope graph <b>600</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. Graph <b>600</b> depicts an example primary cut <b>610</b> and a secondary cut <b>620</b>. In a conventional TKA surgery, the rotation point for the posterior slope is set at the anterior aspect of the tibia, so, the surgeon does not need to worry about increased resection depth for an increased slope recut. For a PKA surgery, the posterior slope is set based on the middle of the tibial plateau, so a secondary cut to change the slope will always include an increase in the resection depth <b>630</b> (e.g., secondary cut bias) to ensure a full resection.</p><p>[0035] The slope and depth of the secondary cut <b>620</b> may be adjustable to provide a desired slope while remaining consistent with other surgical parameters. In an example, a PKA surgical plan may have an associated maximum allowed parallel recut <b>640</b>, which may correspond with a worst-case slope and depth change <b>650</b>. Table 1 shows various combinations of tibial resection depth and slope. In particular, Table 1 shows a minimum increase in depth required to provide a full resection, and shows the maximum increase in resection depth that will result in a resection within 3 mm distal to the primary cut on the anterior/posterior side (e.g., maximum allowed parallel recut).</p><p>[0036] <Table frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"><TR><TD>TABLE 1</TD></TR><TR></TR><TR><TD>Tibial Resection Depth and Slope</TD></TR><TR><TD>Change in</TD><TD>Minimum</TD><TD>Minimum change in</TD><TD>Maximum increase in</TD></TR><TR><TD>Slope (with</TD><TD>change in</TD><TD>resection depth</TD><TD>resection depth (for</TD></TR><TR><TD>respect to</TD><TD>resection</TD><TD>required for</TD><TD>minimum resection</TD></TR><TR><TD>first cut)</TD><TD>depth</TD><TD>full resection</TD><TD>depth change)</TD></TR><TR></TR><TR><TD>0 degrees </TD><TD>0.0</TD><TD> 0 mm</TD><TD><sup></sup>3 mm</TD></TR><TR><TD>2 degrees </TD><TD>0.72</TD><TD> 1.1 mm</TD><TD>3.7 mm</TD></TR><TR><TD>4 degrees </TD><TD>1.43</TD><TD>2.17 mm</TD><TD>4.4 mm</TD></TR><TR><TD>5 degrees </TD><TD>1.79</TD><TD>2.71 mm</TD><TD>4.8 mm</TD></TR><TR><TD>6 degrees </TD><TD>2.15</TD><TD>3.26 mm</TD><TD>5.1 mm</TD></TR><TR><TD>8 degrees </TD><TD>2.88</TD><TD>4.36 mm</TD><TD>5.9 mm</TD></TR><TR><TD>10 degrees </TD><TD>3.61</TD><TD> 5.5 mm</TD><TD>6.6 mm</TD></TR><TR></TR></Table></p><p>[0037] FIG. <b>7</b> is a diagram of a knee arthroplasty graphical user interface (GUI) <b>700</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. GUI <b>700</b> may be used to display information about planned or measured arthroplasty resection depths or angles. GUI <b>700</b> may include an anterior view <b>710</b> of the femoral head <b>720</b> and the proximal tibia <b>730</b>. Similarly, GUI <b>700</b> may include a medial view <b>715</b> of the femoral head <b>725</b> and the proximal tibia <b>735</b>. The anterior view <b>710</b> may have an associated anterior view control <b>740</b>, and the medial view <b>715</b> may have an associated medial view control <b>745</b>, which may be used to rotate the view of the femur and tibia displayed within GUI <b>700</b>. The anterior view <b>710</b> may have an associated anterior tibial control <b>750</b>, and the medial view <b>715</b> may have an associated medial tibial control <b>755</b>, which may be used to change the flexion angle or modify tibial slope or resection. GUI <b>700</b> may also provide information about distal resection depth <b>760</b>, proximal resection depth <b>765</b>, proximal resection slope angles <b>770</b>, posterior slope angles <b>775</b>, hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis angles <b>780</b>, plan laxity measurements <b>785</b>, and a flexion angle <b>790</b>.</p><p>[0038] The display of information, bone views, or other portions within GUI <b>700</b> may be modified to indicate whether one or more steps in the knee arthroplasty surgical procedure have been completed. For example, the proximal resection depth <b>765</b> may be presented in a first color to indicate a sufficient resection depth, and the proximal tibia <b>730</b> and proximal resection angle <b>770</b> may be presented in a second color to indicate additional surgical procedure steps are needed to provide the planned resection slope. In another example, the proximal resection depth <b>765</b> may be presented in a first color to indicate the depth is based on a depth validated by an arthroplasty validation instrument, and the proximal tibia <b>730</b> and proximal resection angle <b>770</b> may be presented in a second color to indicate the displayed resection slope angle is using outdated information.</p><p>[0039] FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D are diagrams of an augment cut validation <b>800</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. <b>8</b>A shows a patient tibia with a partial implant <b>810</b>, such as may be used in a PKA surgical procedure. FIG. <b>8</b>B shows a horizontal revision surgery tibia cut <b>820</b> and a deeper augment cut <b>830</b>. A surgeon may use the revision surgery when a portion of the knee has bad bone quality, where the surgeon can remove the bad bone quality region with an augment implant to provide a stable surface for the femoral implant. FIG. <b>8</b>C shows the revision surgery with an augment implant <b>840</b> and a revision implant <b>850</b>. While FIG. <b>8</b>C shows a revision surgery with a correct augment implant cut depth, FIG. <b>8</b>D shows a revision surgery with an insufficient augment implant cut depth, resulting in a gap <b>860</b>. To determine whether the augment implant cut depth is sufficient, an augment cut validation device may be used, such as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>A.</p><p>[0040] FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C are diagrams of an augment cut validation device <b>900</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The augment cut validation device <b>900</b> may be used to determine whether a revision surgery augment resection and horizontal resection are cut to a correct depth. As shown in FIG. <b>9</b>A, augment cut validation device <b>900</b> may include a tracker mount <b>910</b> and a base <b>920</b>. One or more slide-in augment spacers <b>930</b>, <b>935</b> may be attached to base <b>920</b>. In an example, each augment spacer <b>930</b>, <b>935</b> may have a flange <b>940</b> that slides within base channel <b>925</b> and one or more detents <b>945</b> to secure the augment spacer <b>930</b>, <b>935</b> in a fixed position relative to the augment cut validation device <b>900</b>. As shown in FIG. <b>9</b>B, an augment cut validation device <b>900</b> may have an extended base for validating a surface on a larger bone. As shown in FIG. <b>9</b>C, variously sized augment spacers <b>950</b> may be used. In various examples, the augment spacers <b>950</b> may include incremental sizes, such as 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, or other sizes. In an example, two different sized augment spacers <b>950</b> may be used to validate a first cut dept of a resected surface of a horizontal resection and a deeper cut depth of a resected surface of an augment resection.</p><p>[0041] FIG. <b>10</b> is a diagram of an augment cut validation tracker device <b>1000</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The augment cut validation tracker device <b>1000</b> includes a tracker mount <b>1010</b> that attaches to a tracker attachment <b>1020</b>, which is fixedly attached to an optical tracker <b>1040</b>. The augment cut validation tracker device <b>1000</b> includes one or more augment spacers <b>1030</b> that may be used to validate a revision surgery augment resection and horizontal resection. In an example, surgeon may position the augment cut validation tracker device <b>1000</b> such that the augment spacers <b>1030</b> are in contact with an augment resection and horizontal resection of a patient tibia <b>1050</b>, and the optical tracker <b>1040</b> may be used to determine the depth of the augment resection and horizontal resection by comparing a measured location of the optical tracker <b>1040</b> against a known location of the tibia <b>1050</b>. Similarly, the augment cut validation tracker device <b>1000</b> may be used to compare the augment resection depth to the horizontal resection depth, such as by determining that a vertical axis of the optical tracker <b>1040</b> is offset from the vertical axis of the tibia <b>1050</b>.</p><p>[0042] FIG. <b>11</b> illustrates a flow chart showing a knee arthroplasty technique <b>1100</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. Technique <b>1100</b> may include outputting <b>1110</b> control instructions to cause a robotic surgical device to assist in a resection of a patient tibia or femur. The resection may include a tibial plateau resection, which may include a resected horizontal surface and a resected vertical surface. The resection may include an augment resection, which may include a resected augment surface and a resected revision implant surface.</p><p>[0043] Technique <b>1100</b> includes positioning <b>1120</b> a knee arthroplasty validation device to contact the horizontal resection and to contact the vertical resection. Positioning of the knee arthroplasty validation device may include outputting control instructions to cause the robotic surgical device to position the knee arthroplasty validation device. The knee arthroplasty validation device may include a horizontal resection validation surface, a vertical resection validation surface, one or more augment spacers, and an optical tracker fixedly attached to the knee arthroplasty validation device. The vertical resection validation surface may be orthogonal to the horizontal resection validation surface, and a substantially planar gap validation surface. The gap validation surface may be substantially parallel to the horizontal resection validation surface and separated from the horizontal resection validation surface by a gap validation thickness. The gap validation thickness may be used to validate a flexion gap and an extension gap.</p><p>[0044] Technique <b>1100</b> includes validating <b>1130</b>, using processing circuitry of the robotic surgical device, the horizontal resection based on a tracked validation position of the optical tracker. Technique <b>1100</b> may include validating <b>1135</b>, using processing circuitry of the robotic surgical device, the vertical resection based on a tracked validation position of the optical tracker. Technique <b>1100</b> may include validating <b>1145</b>, using processing circuitry of the robotic surgical device, an augment resection based on a tracked validation position of the optical tracker.</p><p>[0045] Technique <b>1100</b> may include validating <b>1140</b> a flexion gap or an extension gap. Validating <b>1140</b> the flexion gap may include comparing the gap validation thickness of the knee arthroplasty validation device against the flexion gap formed by the patient tibia and a corresponding patient femur in flexion.
